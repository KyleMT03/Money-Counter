# Money-Counter
I created this money counter using HTML, CSS, and JS for some practice with JS mainly. 

Nothing super special, this is the first project I've made in a while using JS. I'm taking getting a job in web development fairly seriously,
so I'm focusing on developing the neccesary skills. Anyways, I basically just used the get element by id to get my HTML id, then I added an event listener 
to each button that would add the corresponding amount to the integer amount. I realized after I needed a clear button so I used the same concept to add that.
